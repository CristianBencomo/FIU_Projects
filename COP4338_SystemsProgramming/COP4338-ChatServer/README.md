Cristian Bencomo


## Description
a client will send 3 types of messages to the other clients

> Resquest: BROADCAST username message:     
> Response: calls the write function of each specific client service other than the sender          
> Meaning: the message sent by 1 client will be displayed for every other client            


> Request: SIGNIN username               
> Response: Either accepts the request or denies it                              
> Meaning: The program will confirm that there is no other user with the same name, and will then assign the username to the socket                                            


> Request: LOGOUT username                                               
> Response: Goodbye message and remove username                                               
> Meaning: The program will delete the username from the users Arraylist and close its corresponding thread and socket
